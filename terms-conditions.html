                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    These Terms & Conditions govern your use of the Universal Solution website and services. By
                    accessing our site or utilizing our services, you agree to comply with these terms in full.

                <h2>Service Agreement</h2>
                <p>
                    Universal Solution operates as a third-party distributor and service facilitator for various
                    internet, cellular, and communication providers. All services are subject to the respective terms
                    and conditions of the service provider, and Universal Solution acts as an intermediary between the
                    customer and provider. Universal Solution does not guarantee service uptime, performance, or
                    features, as these are dependent on the third-party provider.
                </p>

                these Terms & Conditions or the terms of the respective service provider. In such cases, any fees paid
                may not be refundable.

                </p>

                <h2>Governing Law</h2>
                <p>
                    These Terms & Conditions are governed by the laws of the USA, and any disputes arising from these
                    terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Texas.
                </p>

                <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
